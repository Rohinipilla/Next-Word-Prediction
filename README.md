Next Word Prediction using Deep Learning with TensorFlow

This project implements a next word prediction model using TensorFlow, a powerful deep learning framework. The model utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) particularly adept at handling sequential data like text.

Technical Details:

Framework: TensorFlow

Text Preprocessing:

tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text.Tokenizer: Converts text into numerical sequences for machine learning.

Model Architecture:

tensorflow.keras.models.Sequential: Builds a sequential neural network architecture.
tensorflow.keras.layers.Embedding: Captures semantic relationships between words by representing them as vectors.
tensorflow.keras.layers.LSTM: Captures long-term dependencies within sequences, crucial for accurate word prediction.
tensorflow.keras.layers.Dense: Outputs the probability distribution for the next word in the sequence.


Training Process:

tensorflow.keras.utils.to_categorical: Converts target word labels into a one-hot encoded format for training.
tensorflow.keras.optimizers.Adam: Optimizes the model's weights to minimize prediction errors.


Model Persistence:

pickle: Saves the trained model for future use and deployment.
This project demonstrates the power of deep learning for next word prediction. The trained model can be integrated into various applications to enhance user experience and explore creative text generation tasks.

Additionally, the project leverages libraries like NumPy (numpy) and functionalities like file system operations (os) for data manipulation and project management, respectively.


Execution:

First you have to run the file with name "Next Word Prediction-1.ipynb".
Then it will generate "nextword.h5" and "tokenizer1.pkl" and also "model.png"
after that you have to run the "prediction-1.ipnyb" to predict the the next word by giving the previous three to four words.
